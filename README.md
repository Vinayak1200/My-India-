# My Heritage India-Web
My Heritage India - A QR Based Ticketing Solution for the heritage sites.

My Heritage India is a Qr Based Ticketing Solutions for monuments.There is no integrated booking platform for Heritage Sites that provides all basic information about the monument and its main attractions. Furthermore, there is no provision that informs us about the Ticket and Parking Booking facilities and their pricing due to which most people avoid visiting a heritage site.
There is no integrated system for users to use to reserve tickets and parking slots for historical sites, as people mostly prefer to travel by car and they find difficulty to find a parking location when visiting heritage sites.
There is no portal containing correct information about the heritage site such as monument timings, whether it will be open on a specific day or not, ticket pricing and no provision for visitors to visit the monument without a hardcopy of the ticket.
There is no online service request help desk that can be used to contact the authorities.
